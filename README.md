# <Blackjack>
Blackjack, also known as "21", is a classic casino game that is one of the most played casino banking games in the world. In this game, you are dealt two cards, while the dealer reveals one of his cards but keeps another hidden. The point of the game is to have your cards add up to 21 or as close as possible. If you go over 21, you lose. If the dealer goes over 21, you win. You can decide to hit, which means to deal one more card to your hand, or stay, which means to stay put. After you are done, the dealer will deal to his hand until he hits 21, gets closer to 21 than you, or busts.
